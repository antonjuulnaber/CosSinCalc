CosSinCalc is a web application able to calculate the variables of a triangle.  
The live site is located at <http://cossincalc.com/>.

CosSinCalc OFFLINE is an effort to modernize the project and make it acessible offline to danish students who don't have access to the internet during their exams.

The original project already has an offline version, but it is even older than the aging website.

This is the source code of the "program".

The original website is made by Molte Emil Strange Andersen, released under the MIT license (see the `MIT-LICENSE` file).  
The offline version is made by Anton Juul-Naber, released under the MIT license (see the `MIT-LICENSE` file).
